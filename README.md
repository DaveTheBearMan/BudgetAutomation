# How to get attendance from an event 

Use the dquery command on OBIII. You query typically Other or General Meeting for that day, and its usable in any channel.
Sometimes it'll take a little while, but thats just OBIII being slow (running on a nanode somewhere in the cloud) 
Any event involving food requires writing about attendance, so find the attendance from that day, and use the 1010_attendance pdf rather than the regular 1010 pdf.
